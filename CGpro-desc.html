<p> The paper describes a technique using a simple shading method, to create virtual light and approximate the appearence of objects according to the lights.</p>

<p> The above picture shows an environment containing a teapot using virtual lights. </p>
<p> <img src="desc2.png" /> </p>
<p> The above picture shows directional light patterns at selected vertices on an object. </p>
<p> Here, we are using a shading model called 'phong model'. This technique can translate view-independent non-diffuse global illumination solutions into a
    form that is more compact, portable and suitable for fast display. </p>
